✌️ Hey,<br>
I am passionate about new technologies and an enthusiast of designing innovative solutions. My repositories on GitHub are a place where I explore various areas of IT and share my experiments and projects.

My interests also include designing and optimizing game servers, where I strive to create environments that ensure smooth gameplay and unique experiences for users. For example, I am currently working on a project to implement network attack filtering using XDP technology, which will enable efficient network traffic management in online gaming environments.
